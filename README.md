TSO: Transportation System Ontology

The Transportation System Ontology (TSO) is a community-driven open-source ontology in the field of transportation. The TSO is developed to support human- and computer-intepretable standard representation of transportation-related entities and the relations among these entities. The TSO can be applied to support the standardization, sharing, integration, and analysis of transportation-related data and knowledge.   

### TSO Developers:

The TSO is initiated by researchers at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. The first version of TSO was developed by [Dr. Yongqun Oliver He](http://www.hegroup.org/aboutUs/Oliver.html), Associate Professor, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. by collaborating with Dr. Robert C. Hampshire and many researchers in the University of Michigan Transportation Reserach Institute [(UMTRI)](http://www.umtri.umich.edu/). TSO is being applied to support different applications.  

Currently the TSO development team includes many experts from different fields:

[Dr. Robert C. Hampshire](http://www.umtri.umich.edu/who-we-are/staff-directory/robert-c-hampshire), Associate Professor of Public Policy, Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, and research assistant professor in UMTRI's Human Factors group, University of Michigan.   
[Dr. Aditi Misra](http://www.umtri.umich.edu/who-we-are/staff-directory/aditi-misra), an assistant research scientist in UMTRI's CMISST group at the University of Michigan.

Mr. Andong Chen, M.S., Research associate at the University of Michigan UMTRI.  

Mr. Edison Ong, a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics. 

Mr. Sam Smith, a retired engineer at Detroit, MI. 

Dr. Barry Smith, Professor and founder of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is used as the top level ontology of TSO. Note that BFO is a newly approved ISO top levell ontology: https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html. 

Everyone who would like to contribute to the CIDO development is welcome to join our development team. Please contact any of us if you are interested. Thanks.
